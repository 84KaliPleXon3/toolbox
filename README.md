# Fedora Toolbox â€” Hacking on your OSTree-based Fedora

[Fedora Toolbox](https://github.com/debarshiray/fedora-toolbox) is a tool that
offers a familiar RPM based environment for developing and debugging software
on locked down [OSTree](https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)-based Fedora
systems like [Silverblue](https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/). Such
operating systems are shipped as *immutable* OSTree images, where it's
difficult to setup a development environment with your favorite tools, editors
and SDKs. A toolbox container solves that problem by providing a RPM based
*mutable* container. You can tweak it to your heart's content and use DNF to
install your favorite packages, all without worrying about breaking your
operating system.

The toolbox environment is based on the `fedora-toolbox` image. This image is
then customized for the current user to create a toolbox container that
seamlessly integrates with the rest of the operating system.

## Usage

### Create the basic Fedora Toolbox image:
```
[user@hostname fedora-toolbox]$ buildah bud --tag fedora-toolbox:28 .
STEP 1: FROM docker://registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora:28
Getting image source signatures
â€¦
â€¦
â€¦
[user@hostname fedora-toolbox]$
```
Modify the Dockerfile to match your taste and Fedora version. The image should
be tagged as `fedora-toolbox` with a suffix matching the host Fedora version.
eg., `fedora-toolbox:29`, etc..

### Create your Fedora Toolbox container:
```
[user@hostname fedora-toolbox]$ ./fedora-toolbox create
[user@hostname fedora-toolbox]$
```
This will create a container, and an image, called
`fedora-toolbox-<your-username>:28` that's specifically customised for your
host user.

### Enter the Toolbox:
```
[user@hostname fedora-toolbox]$ ./fedora-toolbox enter
ðŸ”¹[user@toolbox ~]$
```
